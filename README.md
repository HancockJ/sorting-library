# Sorting Algorithms
This is a small project I made to practice implementing different sorting algorithms and then comparing their space and time complexities.

Written in Python.

- main.py - Script to utilize the libraries I created and give a nice command line output.
- sort.py - module with functions for various sorting algorithms.
  - Bubble sort
  - Better bubble sort
  - Selection sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Quick sort
  - Merge sort
  - Counting sort
  - Radix sort
- measure.py - module with functions to measure different algorithms speeds.

# TODO:
- [ ] Create a function to run each algorithm X amount of times with a different random set of numbers and then calculate average time taken.
- [ ] Make it easy to choose all of your preferred inputs via command line arguments or other methods (range of integers, range of integer array size, times to run, etc...).
- [ ] Integrate more measurements like space complexity.
- [ ] Add in more sorting methods.
